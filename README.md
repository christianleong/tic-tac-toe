##About
Tic-tac-toe is a simple turn based strategy game where 2 players, X and O, take turns marking spaces on a 3 x 3 grid. The first player to place 3 of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line is the winner.

##Bugs to fix
The board should be stationary instead of shifting up when a player wins and down when the game resets.

##Lessons learnt
Firstly, I tried to work out the solution 

##Ideas
- Strike through the winning boxes
    - Add sound effect when striking through
- Clone and add a cool/fun theme
- Add animation to restart game when it appears
- Add animation to X and O when they appear on the board
